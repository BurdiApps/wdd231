2. Click **Resize**
3. Set Width: **400**, Height: **300**

## Step 3: Pick Your Business
Start with the easiest: **Bolthouse Farms** (it's just a carrot!)

## Step 4: Choose Colors
Click the color squares and add these colors:
- `#ff6b35` (Orange - for carrot)
- `#228b22` (Green - for leaves)
- `#87ceeb` (Sky Blue - for background)

2. Click **Fill tool** (paint bucket)
3. Click canvas

### Ground:
1. Select brown `#8b4513`
2. Click **Rectangle tool**
3. Draw rectangle at bottom (1/3 of canvas)

### Giant Carrot:
1. Select orange `#ff6b35`
2. Click **Pen tool**
3. Draw triangle shape (wide at top, narrow at bottom)
4. Make it BIG and centered

### Carrot Leaves:

3. Keep them simple and spiky

### Outline (optional):
1. Select black `#2c2c2c`
2. Trace around your carrot with 1-2 pixel line

### Add Text:
1. Below carrot, write "BOLTHOUSE" in pixels
2. Use the pen tool to draw letters pixel by pixel
3. OR skip text - the carrot is enough!

## Step 6: Export
1. Click **File** → **Export**
2. Choose **PNG**
3. Download the file
4. Rename to: `bolthouse.png`
5. Move to: `c:\Users\Burdi\WDD_231\chamber\images\`

## Step 7: Update JSON (if using PNG)
If you're replacing .jpg with .png files:

Open `chamber/data/members.json` and change:
```json
"image": "bolthouse.jpg"
```
to:
```json
"image": "bolthouse.png"
```

## Step 8: Test!

## 🎯 Next: Repeat for Other Businesses

### Easy Ones (5-10 minutes each):

3. **Dignity Health** - Draw red cross on white
4. **McCarthy** - Draw a crane

### Medium Difficulty (10-15 minutes):

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Too Hard? Go ULTRA-SIMPLE:
- Make 200x200px images instead of 400x300
- Just create simple ICONS:
  - Bank = Building with $
  - Hospital = Red +
  - Oil = Single derrick
  - Farm = Carrot
  - Hotel = Building
  - Music = Guitar
  - Construction = Hard hat

### Color Palette Trick:
In Piskel, create your palette once, then:
- File → Save
- Open for each new image
- Colors are already loaded!

### Common Mistakes:
❌ Too much detail (keep it simple!)
❌ Too many colors (8-16 max)
❌ Anti-aliasing on (keep edges crisp)
✅ Big, bold shapes
✅ High contrast
✅ Recognizable silhouettes
